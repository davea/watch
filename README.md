watch
=====

Refreshes your browser when source files change during local development.

By default will refresh Chrome, but can refresh Safari also - see the `event_callback` function.

##Usage

`watch.py <path_to_watch> <url_match_to_refresh>`

e.g. to refresh any browser tabs with `localhost` in the URL when a source file in the current directory changes:

`watch.py . localhost`

##Requirements
 * OS X
